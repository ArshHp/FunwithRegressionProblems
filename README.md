# FunwithRegressionProblems

1. Solving basic linear equations using Linear Regression APIs. 
2. Understand what is interept & model coefficients and how to determine values using scikit learn.
3. Visualize numerical data with Seaborn & Matplotlib APIs.
4. Apply Gradient Descent, Stochastic Gradient Decent, Mini Batch Gradient Decent algorithms and understand the key differences between them. 
5. Evaluation metrics for numerical problems like RMSE, MSE, R^2 Score & their key differences & significances.
