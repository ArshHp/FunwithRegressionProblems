The dataset attached contains the data of 160 different bags associated with ABC industries. The bags have certain attributes which are described below:
1.	Height – The height of the bag
2.	Width – The width of the bag
3.	Length – The length of the bag
4.	Weight – The weight the bag can carry
5.	Weight1 – Weight the bag can carry after expansion
 
The company now wants to predict the cost they should set for a new variant of these kinds of bags based on the attributes below. As a result, they want you to build a prediction model which can correctly set the cost of the bag provided the attributes are given. The task involves the following things:
•	Analyse the dataset and do EDA(Exploratory Data Analysis) 
•	Plotting of various graphs & correlations 
•	Model Building using Multiple Linear Regression 
•	Calculating the R squared, RMSE and MSE for the model
